This is a MMORTS game, meaning it is a massively multiplayer online real time strategy game.
In the game, you control an army which you have to build by tasking workers to mine silver and gold, 
while you task other workers to kill animals for food, grow crops, or chop down wood.

Because everything is realtime, enemies will also harvest resources, and minimize the fight for resources, 
things will regenerate every 15 minute or so.
Newcomers will get 1 week of peace before they can be attacked, so they can build resources.

When it comes to fighting, You can only attack armies which have 10 more or 10 less average level. The average
level is calculated by adding the combat leve of all the soldiers, and dividing by the number(Std. Average generating)
